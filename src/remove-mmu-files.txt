The following MMU-related files can be safely removed as they're not used by the Coffee Fund system:

1. src/screens/MMUDashboard.jsx
2. src/screens/mmu/ (entire directory with all its files)

These files were related to the previous MMU (Mountains of the Moon University) system, but the application has been refocused to be only about the Inspire Africa Coffee Fund.

The Coffee Fund system only depends on:
- src/screens/coffee/ (directory)
- src/screens/auth/ (directory)
- src/screens/CoffeeFundDashboard.jsx

Remember to back up these files before deleting them, in case they're needed for reference later.
